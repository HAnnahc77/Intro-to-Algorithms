This is the selection

Sequencing = Has defined variables in the beginning of the code and a certain order to follow in order for the progam to occur in a certain order
Selection = Contains an if statement which allows for conditioned decision making
Iteration = Because of the inclusion of the for code, it is able to repeat for certain variables of i
